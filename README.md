# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This is an end-to-end machine learning project that predicts housing prices using the **Boston Housing dataset**.  
The model achieves **over 90% accuracy (R² Score)** using **Random Forest Regression** and hyperparameter tuning.

## 📊 Project Overview

- ✅ Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset
- 🔍 Removed outliers using Z-score method
- 🌲 Used **Random Forest Regressor** with **GridSearchCV** for tuning
- 💾 Saved the final model using `joblib`
- 📉 Evaluated performance using R² Score and MSE
- 📈 Visualized actual vs predicted housing prices

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **scikit-learn**
- **Scipy**, **Joblib**

---

## 🚀 Results

- **R² Score:** ~0.90+
- **MSE:** ~9–12

The Random Forest model outperformed basic linear models and gave robust predictions after tuning and outlier removal.
